# VBA-Challenge

VBA challenge involves creating a script that loops through all of the stocks
for each year (2018, 2019, 2020) and outputs the following:

The ticker symbol.

Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning
of a given year to the closing price at the end of that
year.

The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning
of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The Total stock volume of the stock.

The greatest % increase.

The greatest % decrease.

Greatest total volume.


*Technologies used: Microsoft Excel and VBA

*How to activate code: Once 'Multiple_year_stock_data_Takan.xlsm' is open
select developer tab and then click visual basic button. Then select 
run Sub/User Form. The end result will be produced across all 
worksheets.

*Comment: One thing that would have been great on the challenge is if I 
was able to loop through the worksheets in a way that doesn't slow 
down the system. I know there's alot of data to go through but somehow modifying
the code to process at a faster rate would have been great.
